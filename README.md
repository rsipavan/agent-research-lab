![Pipeline demo](demo.gif)

*Live run of the pipeline on a real YouTube trading video: transcript fetch → claim extraction → validation → honest verdict. Above: a strategy that under-specifies its instrument gets classified `untestable` with the structural reason.*

I got tired of watching trading videos that confidently claim a strategy "works consistently" with nothing to back it up. So I built a system that checks.

You give it a YouTube URL. It pulls the transcript, figures out what kind of video it is, extracts any claims that could actually be tested against market data, and then tests them — with real data, through TradingView, using explicit rules. The report tells you what it found, how confident the numbers are, and exactly where the reasoning stopped if it couldn't conclude anything.

It's not a trading bot. It doesn't generate signals or execute trades. The domain is trading content. The engineering pattern — deterministic evaluation, observable workflows, graceful degradation — applies to any autonomous research pipeline operating under uncertainty.

**→ Read [`docs/REASONING.md`](docs/REASONING.md) for the deep-dive on the design choice that defines this system: why "untestable" is a first-class verdict, and why most autonomous validation systems get this wrong.** Also published as an essay: [Why "untestable" is a first-class verdict](https://rsaipavan.substack.com/p/why-untestable-is-a-first-class-verdict).

## What this looks like in practice

The ICT Silver Bullet strategy has fully mechanical rules: liquidity sweep of a prior session high or low, followed by a displacement candle, a market structure shift, and a retracement entry into the fair value gap. Stop above/below the first FVG candle. Target 2:1 or the opposing liquidity level. Minimum 15 pips (forex) or 10 points (indices).

The extractor formalized all of it. Then it stopped.

```
Claim extracted:
  During 3–4 AM, 10–11 AM, and 2–3 PM New York time: enter on a retracement into a
  fair value gap following a liquidity sweep + displacement candle + market structure
  shift. Stop above/below the first FVG candle. Target 2:1 or opposing liquidity
  (min 15 pips forex / 10 points indices).
  → test_type: strategy_backtest | testable: no

Why not tested:
  Entry, stop, and target rules are fully mechanical and testable, but no specific
  instrument is named — "forex" and "indices" are categories, not tickers.
```

It did not guess EURUSD. It did not guess ES1!. It did not fabricate a win rate. It said what it knew and stopped.

That's the epistemic floor. The pipeline only backtests what the video actually specified. A claim that is missing a required input — instrument, timeframe, or measurable outcome — gets classified `untestable` with one sentence explaining exactly what's missing.

This matters because the alternative — assuming EURUSD, synthesizing a Pine Script, reporting "67% win rate" — would be a hallucination with a confidence interval attached. The system is designed to produce fewer results, not more confident ones.

## What you need before running this

**Python 3.10+** — check with `python --version`.

**Claude Code (the `claude` CLI)** — this is the default LLM backend for claim extraction and Pine Script synthesis. Install it from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) or via npm:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
Once installed, run `claude` once to authenticate with your Anthropic account. No API key setup needed — it uses your Claude subscription. If you'd rather use the Anthropic or Gemini API directly, see the LLM backend section below.

**YouTube transcripts** — the pipeline pulls captions from YouTube via `youtube-transcript-api`. This works on any video that has transcripts enabled (auto-generated or manual). If a video has transcripts disabled, the run returns `untestable — no transcript available` and stops. Most trading tutorial videos have auto-captions.

**TradingView Desktop + MCP** *(for live validation only)* — without this, the pipeline still runs but all validation steps return `untestable — MCP not configured`. Claim extraction, classification, and reporting all still work. To enable live validation:

1. Install [TradingView Desktop](https://www.tradingview.com/desktop/) and open it
2. Enable remote debugging: launch TradingView with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` (or set it in the app's launch options)
3. Install the TradingView MCP server — follow the setup at [github.com/tradingview/tradingview-mcp](https://github.com/tradingview/tradingview-mcp)
4. Set `TRADINGVIEW_MCP_CMD` in your `.env` to the command that launches the MCP server

**Strategy backtests are off by default.** `config.yml` has `strategy_backtest: false` in v1. If you run a strategy video without enabling it, the claim will be extracted and classified correctly but marked `untestable — test type disabled`. To enable: set `strategy_backtest: true` in `config.yml` and make sure the TradingView MCP is configured.

## Try it

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m trading_hypothesis_lab.orchestrate "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

What happens:

```
Transcript fetched      — pulls and cleans the YouTube transcript
        ↓
Video classified        — is this a strategy claim, market commentary, a course pitch?
        ↓
Claims extracted        — each claim tagged: instrument, timeframe, test type, testable?
        ↓
Claim operationalized   — trigger condition + outcome window formalized into a runnable test
        ↓
Validation executed     — real market data via TradingView MCP; strategy claims get Pine Script synthesized, compiled, and backtested
        ↓
Verdict computed        — thresholds applied in code, not asked of the LLM: holds / partial / fails / untestable
```

Here's real output from [`examples/06_orb_pine_strategy_backtest/`](examples/06_orb_pine_strategy_backtest/):

```
Claim extracted:
  ORB: enter long when price closes above the first-15-minute high, enter short when
  price closes below the first-15-minute low. Stop at the opposite end of the opening
  range. Target 1.5x range size. Exit all positions by 3 PM. Works consistently on SPY.
  → instrument: SPY | timeframe: 5m | test_type: strategy_backtest | testable: yes

Validation:
  Pine Script synthesized → compiled (0 errors) → strategy tester run
  66 trades | win rate 48% | net profit −4,082 | profit factor 0.91 | max drawdown 6,560

Verdict:
  NOT SUPPORTED — no edge: profit factor 0.91, net profit −4,082.41 over 66 trades
```

The trace for that run:

```jsonl
{"step": "transcript.fetch",  "ok": true, "ms": 0,     "detail": "fetched 218 words"}
{"step": "video.summarize",   "ok": true, "ms": 312,   "detail": "strategy_or_claim — ORB intraday strategy — SPY 5-minute"}
{"step": "thesis.extract",    "ok": true, "ms": 1847,  "detail": "1 claim: 1 testable, 0 not"}
{"step": "pine.run",          "ok": true, "ms": 28340, "detail": "PF 0.91 over 66 trades — net negative"}
{"step": "report.build",      "ok": true, "ms": 4,     "detail": "verdict_overall=fails; 1 claim"}
```

Everything saves to `runs/<run_id>/` — transcript, summary, extracted claims, report, trace, and the `.pine` file if one was generated.

    P -.trace.-> T
    F -.trace.-> T
```

**Step 1 — Ingest.** `transcript.py` fetches and cleans the YouTube transcript.

**Step 2 — Summarize.** Before extracting any claims, `summarize.py` figures out what kind of video this is — strategy walkthrough, educational explainer, market commentary, course pitch, vlog. If it's the kind of video that doesn't make checkable claims by nature (mindset content, promos), the pipeline stops here and returns a summary-only report. No point extracting claims from a sales pitch.

**Step 3 — Extract.** For claim-bearing videos, `thesis.py` pulls out the testable claims. Each one gets tagged with instrument, timeframe, test type, and a judgment on whether it's actually testable — with a reason if not. The extractor is expected to say "that's a take, not a claim." It also gets prior failure traces injected from the knowledge base, so it knows what's gone wrong on similar claims before.

**Step 4 — Validate.** Two paths depending on claim type. Indicator and level claims go to `validate.py`, which fetches OHLCV data from TradingView, computes the relevant indicator in Python, and measures the hit rate over a multi-year lookback. Strategy claims go to `pine.py`, which synthesizes a complete Pine Script strategy from the transcript, compiles it via TradingView MCP with an LLM self-repair loop (up to 3 fix attempts), runs the strategy tester, and returns real backtest metrics.

**Step 5 — Report.** `report.py` leads with what the video actually is, then walks through each claim — what was said, what was testable, what the data showed, and why the system concluded what it did. Verdicts come from explicit thresholds applied to the validation data, not from asking the LLM to judge anything. If a strategy is a consistent loser to the point that reversing every entry and exit would have cleared the holds threshold, the report flags that as a hypothesis mutation finding.

**Step 6 — Reply.** If you're running the Telegram bot, it sends live progress updates as each step completes (editing a single status message rather than spamming), chart screenshots, trade overlays for strategy claims, the full report, and the `.pine` file as an attachment.

**Step 7 — Accumulate.** Every run appends to `knowledge/store.jsonl` — how the claim was formalized, what failure modes came up, what the validation found. The next time a similar claim comes through, the extractor gets those prior traces as context. Not self-improving trading. Self-improving reliability.

**Step 8 — Trace.** Every step writes one line to `traces/<run-id>.jsonl` with timing and outcome. The examples in this repo include their full traces so you can see exactly what the system did on each run.

## The design choices that matter

A few things I kept coming back to while building this:

**Verdicts come from code, not the model.** The LLM extracts claims and synthesizes Pine Script. It doesn't decide whether a claim holds. That decision comes from thresholds applied to real numbers — hit rate, profit factor, trade count. Same data always gives the same verdict. You can audit it.

**Every failure mode has a name and a return value.** Nothing silently crashes or returns a misleading result. If the transcript is empty, that's a named outcome. If the MCP times out, that's a named outcome. If the Pine Script won't compile after 3 attempts, the file still gets saved, the run still completes, and the trace says exactly what happened. The system degrades — it doesn't disappear.

**"Untestable" is a first-class result.** Most of the examples in this repo end with `untestable`. That's the system working correctly, not failing. A lot of trading content doesn't make checkable claims — it makes predictions, narratives, and sales pitches. Saying so clearly is more useful than manufacturing a test result.

**The trace is always there.** Every run leaves a `trace.jsonl` with one line per step — timing, outcome, detail. Not for debugging (though it helps there too). For trust. Anyone reading the report can open the trace and see exactly what the system did.

**The memory accumulates across runs.** `knowledge/store.jsonl` grows with every run, and the extractor gets prior failure traces as context. If ORB has failed to compile three times due to ambiguous exit rules, the next ORB extraction knows that. The system gets more reliable over time, not by learning what's profitable, but by learning where the operationalization breaks down.

## Examples

[`examples/`](examples/) has real YouTube trading videos run through the full pipeline. Each folder is a complete run: transcript, extracted claims, validation, report, and trace. Read one to see exactly what the system did and why.

| Example | Video type | Verdict |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [01 — RSI + Bollinger Bands backtest](examples/01_rsi_bollinger_tested_2025/) | Strategy backtest (video author's own test) | untestable — no MCP-resolvable claims |
| [02 — RSI: profitable or overhyped?](examples/02_rsi_profitable_or_overhyped/) | Market commentary | untestable — opinion, not checkable |
| [03 — RSI divergence on XAUUSD](examples/03_rsi_divergence_xauusd/) | Educational explainer | untestable — strategy without named instrument |
| [04 — AlphaInsider promo walkthrough](examples/04_alphainsider_promo_walkthrough/) | Promotion | untestable — no checkable claim |
| [05 — ORB acceptance short, no claims](examples/05_orb_acceptance_short_no_claims/) | Short / mindset | untestable — no claims |
| [06 — ORB Pine strategy backtest](examples/06_orb_pine_strategy_backtest/) | Strategy claim | fails — 66 trades, 48.5% WR, PF 0.91 (net negative) |
| [07 — ICT key levels framework](examples/07_ict_key_levels_educational/) | Educational framework | untestable — teaching a methodology, no specific claim |
| [08 — SPY 200-day SMA support](examples/08_spy_200sma_support_holds/) | Indicator claim | **holds** — 73% of 52 occurrences, above 65% threshold |

## Run history (live)

Aggregated outcomes across every video I've put through the pipeline. Updated as the corpus grows. The point of these numbers isn't to look impressive — it's to demonstrate the verdict distribution the design produces.

| Metric | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Total videos processed | _TBD_ | 100% |
| Videos producing a testable claim | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |
| Verdict: `pass` (claim holds against data) | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |
| Verdict: `fail` (claim contradicted by data) | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |
| Verdict: `partial` (mixed evidence) | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |
| Verdict: `untestable` (claim well-formed but unverifiable) | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |
| Verdict: `error` (pipeline failure, recoverable next run) | _TBD_ | _TBD_% |

**Top reasons for `untestable`:**
- _TBD_ — strategy described without a specific instrument
- _TBD_ — claim is a directional opinion (no falsifiable threshold)
- _TBD_ — video is mindset / promotional content (no checkable claim)
- _TBD_ — required input missing (timeframe, stop rule, etc.)

The `untestable` plurality is expected and is the point. Most trading content is uncheckable. A system that produces verdicts for everything is producing fabrications.

## Running it

```bash
# install
pip install -e .

# one-shot: prints the report and saves the full bundle to runs/<run_id>/
python -m trading_hypothesis_lab.orchestrate "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# test indicator claims across multiple timeframes
python -m trading_hypothesis_lab.orchestrate "https://youtu.be/..." --timeframe 60,240,D,W

# scan a claim across an entire watchlist
python -m trading_hypothesis_lab.orchestrate "https://youtu.be/..." --watchlist nifty50

# run the Telegram bot
python -m trading_hypothesis_lab.telegram_bot
```

**No API key needed by default.** The pipeline auto-detects an LLM backend in this order:

1. The `claude` CLI on your PATH ([Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)) — uses your existing subscription, no key needed
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set — `pip install 'trading-hypothesis-lab[anthropic]'`
3. `GEMINI_API_KEY` set — free tier works fine — `pip install 'trading-hypothesis-lab[gemini]'`

For the Telegram bot, set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`. For live validation, set `TRADINGVIEW_MCP_CMD` to the command that launches your TradingView MCP. Without it, validation steps return `untestable — MCP not configured` and everything else still runs fine.

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` to get started. `config.yml` controls timeframes, verdict thresholds, and which test types are enabled.

Watchlists available with `--watchlist`:

| Name | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `default` | 16 cross-market symbols: SPX, NDX, DJI, DAX, NIFTY, BTCUSD, ETHUSD, EURUSD, XAUUSD, USOIL, and more |
| `nifty50` | 50 Nifty 50 constituents (NSE India) |
| `sp500` | 50 S&P 500 large-caps |
| `crypto` | 10 major crypto pairs |
| `forex` | 10 major FX pairs |
| `commodities` | 8 commodities |

## What this isn't

No live trading. No exchange connections. No strategy library. No "AI finds profitable setups." Adding any of that would make this a worse repo, not a better one.
